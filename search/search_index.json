This is a set of guidelines for contributing to IceCore Hashids. Please take a moment to review this document to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. As for everything else in the project, the contributions to IceCore Hashids are governed by our Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior via email . Getting Started \u00b6 ObjectMappers is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community! There are many ways to contribute, from writing- and improving documentation and tutorials , reporting bugs , submitting enhancement suggestions which can be incorporated into IceCore Hashids itself by submitting a pull request . The project development workflow and process uses GitHub Issues - and Pull Requests management to track issues and pull requests. Before you continue with this contribution guideslines we highly recommend to read the awesome GitHub Open source Guide on how to making open source contributions . Bug Reports \u00b6 A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. This section guides you through submitting a bug report for IceCore Hashids. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior and find related reports. Do NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues! Please contact the core team members and the project owner in a responsible manner by email only. We will assess the issue as soon as possible on a best-effort basis and will give you an estimate for when we have a fix and release available for an eventual public disclosure. Use the GitHub Issues search \u2014 check if the issue has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open , add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. Check if the issue has been fixed \u2014 try to reproduce it using the latest version and develop branch in the repository. Isolate the problem \u2014 ideally create a MCVE . When you are creating a bug report, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template , the information it asks for helps maintainers to reproduce the problem and resolve issues faster. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps . Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you are providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue . If possible please provide more context by answering these questions: Did the problem start happening recently (for example after updating to a new version of IceCore Hashids) or was this always a problem? If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of IceCore Hashids ? What is the most recent version in which the problem does not happen? Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens. Please include details about your configuration and environment: What is the version of IceCore Hashids you are using? What is the name and the version of the OS you\u2019re using? - Have you tried to reproduce it on different OS environments and if yes is the behavior the same for all? Which Java JDK/JRE distribution and version are you using? ( Oracle , OpenJDK , \u2026) Are you running the project with your IDE or Maven? - Are you using any additional CLI arguments for Java or Maven? - What is the name and the version of the IDE you\u2019re using? Enhancement Suggestions \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Use the GitHub Issues search \u2014 check if this enhancement has already been suggested. If it has and the issue is still open , add your additions as comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Check if the enhancement has already been implemented \u2014 use the latest version and develop branch to ensure that the feature or improvement has not already been added. Provide a reduced show case \u2014 ideally create a MCVE . Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check if your idea fits with the scope and provide as much detail and context as possible using a structured layout like the the issue template . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible and provide use-cases. Provide examples to demonstrate the need of an enhancement . Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue . Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most IceCore Hashids users. List some other libraries where this enhancement exists. Pull Requests \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an pull request. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to better understand your code. Please suggest an enhancement or report a bug first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, fixing a bug), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the core team members and project owner might not want to merge into the project. When you are submitting an pull request, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template to help maintainers to understand your submitted code. Use a clear and descriptive title for the pull request Do not include issue numbers in the pull request title but fill in the metadata section at the top of the required pull request template making use of the GitHub issue keywords to link to specific enhancement suggestions or bug reports . Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the change. Make sure to follow the Java and Git commit message style guides . Remain focused in scope and avoid to include unrelated commits . Features and improvements should always be accompanied with tests and documentation . If the pull request improves the performance consider to include a benchmark test, optimally including a chart. Lint and test before submitting the pull request . Make sure to create the pull request from a topic branch . All pull requests must be send against the develop branch - Please read the branch organization section below for details about the branching model. Documentations \u00b6 IceCore Hashids has two main sets of documentation: the docs and guides, which helps users to learn about the project, and the API, which serves as a reference. You can help improve the docs and guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, bringing them up to date when there are differences to the latest version. This can be done by submitting a enhancement suggestion and then opening a pull request for it. Branch Organization \u00b6 The IceCore Hashids uses the gitflow branching model. The repository consists of two core branches with an infinite development lifecycle: master - The source code of HEAD always reflects a tagged release version. develop - The default branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest development state. All pull requests for the limited development lifecycle story **/** topic branches must be send against the develop branch . How else can I help? \u00b6 Improve Issues \u00b6 Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. You can help to make it easier for maintainer to understand and resolve them faster. Since handling issues takes a lot of time that could rather spend on writing code. Give Feedback On Issues and Pull Requests \u00b6 We\u2019re always looking for more opinions on discussions in issues and pull request reviews which is a good opportunity to influence the future direction of IceCore Hashids. The question issue label is a good place to find ongoing discussions and questions. StyleguIDes \u00b6 Every major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and Git commit messages. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style. A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition. Java Code Style \u00b6 IceCore Hasids adheres to the [Nullables Studio Java Style Guide][styleguide-java-github]. [![][styleguide-java-badge]][styleguide-java-github] Git Commit Messages \u00b6 A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to the maintainers. The code will tell what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell why. Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can\u2019t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible. IceCore Hasids adheres to the [Nullables Studio Git Style Guide][styleguide-git-github]. [![][styleguide-git-badge]][styleguide-git-github] The style guide assumes that you are familiar with the gitflow branching model. MCVE \u00b6 A Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example. When reporting a bug , sometimes even when suggestig a enhancement , the issue can be processed faster if you provide code for reproduction. That code should be\u2026 \u2026Minimal \u2013 Use as little code as possible that still produces the same behavior \u2026Complete \u2013 Provide all parts needed to reproduce the behavior \u2026Verifiable \u2013 Test the code you\u2019re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the behavior A MCVE is a common practice like on Stack Overflow and sometimes it is also called SSCCE , a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example . The recommended way for GitHub based projects is to create it as Gist or new repository, but of course you can attach it to issues and pull requests as files , use any free code paste- or file hosting service or paste the code in Markdown code blocks into the issue. Minimal \u00b6 The more code there is to go through, the less likely developers can understand your enhancement or find the bug. Streamline your example in one of two ways: Restart from scratch . Create new code, adding in only what is needed to demonstrate the behavior and is also useful if you can\u2019t post the original code publicly for legal or ethical reasons. Divide and conquer . When you have a small amount of code, but the source of the bug is entirely unclear, start removing code a bit at a time until the problem disappears \u2013 then add the last part back and document this behavior to help developers to trace- and debug faster. Minimal and readable \u00b6 Minimal does not mean terse \u2013 don\u2019t sacrifice communication to brevity. Use consistent naming and indentation following the styleguIDe , and include comments if needed to explain portions of the code. Complete \u00b6 Make sure all resources and code necessary to reproduce the behavior is included. The problem might not be in the part you suspect it is, but another part entirely. Verifiable \u00b6 To entirely understand your enhancement or bug report, developers will need to verify that it exists : Follow the contribution guidelines regarding the description and details . Without information developers won\u2019t be able to understand and reproduce the behavior. Eliminate any issues that aren\u2019t relevant . Ensure that there are no compile-time errors. Make sure that the example actually reproduces the problem . Sometimes the bug gets fixed inadvertently or unconsciously while composing the example or does not occur when running on fresh machine environment. Versioning \u00b6 IceCore Hashids follows the [Arctic Versioning Specification][arcver] (ArcVer) which is a lightweight and fully compatible derivative of Semantic Versioning (SemVer). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for enhancements like new features and improvements, and major versions for any backwards incompatible changes. Deprecation warnings are introduced for breaking changes in a minor version so that users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance. Every significant change is documented in the changelog .

Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people\u2019s desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this Code of Conduct. Please avoid unstructured critique. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome. Publishing others\u2019 private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Responsibilities \u00b6 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Enforcement \u00b6 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project core team members or owner via email . The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

This is a set of guidelines for contributing to IceCore Hashids. Please take a moment to review this document to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. As for everything else in the project, the contributions to IceCore Hashids are governed by our Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior via email . Getting Started \u00b6 ObjectMappers is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community! There are many ways to contribute, from writing- and improving documentation and tutorials , reporting bugs , submitting enhancement suggestions which can be incorporated into IceCore Hashids itself by submitting a pull request . The project development workflow and process uses GitHub Issues - and Pull Requests management to track issues and pull requests. Before you continue with this contribution guideslines we highly recommend to read the awesome GitHub Open source Guide on how to making open source contributions . Bug Reports \u00b6 A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. This section guides you through submitting a bug report for IceCore Hashids. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior and find related reports. Do NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues! Please contact the core team members and the project owner in a responsible manner by email only. We will assess the issue as soon as possible on a best-effort basis and will give you an estimate for when we have a fix and release available for an eventual public disclosure. Use the GitHub Issues search \u2014 check if the issue has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open , add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. Check if the issue has been fixed \u2014 try to reproduce it using the latest version and develop branch in the repository. Isolate the problem \u2014 ideally create a MCVE . When you are creating a bug report, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template , the information it asks for helps maintainers to reproduce the problem and resolve issues faster. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps . Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you are providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue . If possible please provide more context by answering these questions: Did the problem start happening recently (for example after updating to a new version of IceCore Hashids) or was this always a problem? If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of IceCore Hashids ? What is the most recent version in which the problem does not happen? Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens. Please include details about your configuration and environment: What is the version of IceCore Hashids you are using?

Enhancement Suggestions \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Use the GitHub Issues search \u2014 check if this enhancement has already been suggested. If it has and the issue is still open , add your additions as comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Check if the enhancement has already been implemented \u2014 use the latest version and develop branch to ensure that the feature or improvement has not already been added. Provide a reduced show case \u2014 ideally create a MCVE . Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check if your idea fits with the scope and provide as much detail and context as possible using a structured layout like the the issue template . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible and provide use-cases. Provide examples to demonstrate the need of an enhancement . Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue . Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most IceCore Hashids users. List some other libraries where this enhancement exists. Pull Requests \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an pull request. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to better understand your code. Please suggest an enhancement or report a bug first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, fixing a bug), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the core team members and project owner might not want to merge into the project. When you are submitting an pull request, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template to help maintainers to understand your submitted code. Use a clear and descriptive title for the pull request Do not include issue numbers in the pull request title but fill in the metadata section at the top of the required pull request template making use of the GitHub issue keywords to link to specific enhancement suggestions or bug reports . Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the change. Make sure to follow the Java and Git commit message style guides . Remain focused in scope and avoid to include unrelated commits . Features and improvements should always be accompanied with tests and documentation . If the pull request improves the performance consider to include a benchmark test, optimally including a chart. Lint and test before submitting the pull request . Make sure to create the pull request from a topic branch . All pull requests must be send against the develop branch - Please read the branch organization section below for details about the branching model. Documentations \u00b6 IceCore Hashids has two main sets of documentation: the docs and guides, which helps users to learn about the project, and the API, which serves as a reference. You can help improve the docs and guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, bringing them up to date when there are differences to the latest version. This can be done by submitting a enhancement suggestion and then opening a pull request for it. Branch Organization \u00b6 The IceCore Hashids uses the gitflow branching model. The repository consists of two core branches with an infinite development lifecycle: master - The source code of HEAD always reflects a tagged release version. develop - The default branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest development state. All pull requests for the limited development lifecycle story **/** topic branches must be send against the develop branch . How else can I help? \u00b6 Improve Issues \u00b6 Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. You can help to make it easier for maintainer to understand and resolve them faster. Since handling issues takes a lot of time that could rather spend on writing code. Give Feedback On Issues and Pull Requests \u00b6 We\u2019re always looking for more opinions on discussions in issues and pull request reviews which is a good opportunity to influence the future direction of IceCore Hashids. The question issue label is a good place to find ongoing discussions and questions. StyleguIDes \u00b6 Every major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and Git commit messages. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style. A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition. Java Code Style \u00b6 IceCore Hasids adheres to the [Nullables Studio Java Style Guide][styleguide-java-github]. [![][styleguide-java-badge]][styleguide-java-github] Git Commit Messages \u00b6 A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to the maintainers. The code will tell what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell why. Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can\u2019t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible. IceCore Hasids adheres to the [Nullables Studio Git Style Guide][styleguide-git-github]. [![][styleguide-git-badge]][styleguide-git-github] The style guide assumes that you are familiar with the gitflow branching model. MCVE \u00b6 A Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example. When reporting a bug , sometimes even when suggestig a enhancement , the issue can be processed faster if you provide code for reproduction. That code should be\u2026 \u2026Minimal \u2013 Use as little code as possible that still produces the same behavior \u2026Complete \u2013 Provide all parts needed to reproduce the behavior \u2026Verifiable \u2013 Test the code you\u2019re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the behavior A MCVE is a common practice like on Stack Overflow and sometimes it is also called SSCCE , a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example . The recommended way for GitHub based projects is to create it as Gist or new repository, but of course you can attach it to issues and pull requests as files , use any free code paste- or file hosting service or paste the code in Markdown code blocks into the issue. Minimal \u00b6 The more code there is to go through, the less likely developers can understand your enhancement or find the bug. Streamline your example in one of two ways: Restart from scratch . Create new code, adding in only what is needed to demonstrate the behavior and is also useful if you can\u2019t post the original code publicly for legal or ethical reasons. Divide and conquer . When you have a small amount of code, but the source of the bug is entirely unclear, start removing code a bit at a time until the problem disappears \u2013 then add the last part back and document this behavior to help developers to trace- and debug faster. Minimal and readable \u00b6 Minimal does not mean terse \u2013 don\u2019t sacrifice communication to brevity. Use consistent naming and indentation following the styleguIDe , and include comments if needed to explain portions of the code. Complete \u00b6 Make sure all resources and code necessary to reproduce the behavior is included. The problem might not be in the part you suspect it is, but another part entirely. Verifiable \u00b6 To entirely understand your enhancement or bug report, developers will need to verify that it exists : Follow the contribution guidelines regarding the description and details . Without information developers won\u2019t be able to understand and reproduce the behavior. Eliminate any issues that aren\u2019t relevant . Ensure that there are no compile-time errors. Make sure that the example actually reproduces the problem . Sometimes the bug gets fixed inadvertently or unconsciously while composing the example or does not occur when running on fresh machine environment. Versioning \u00b6 IceCore Hashids follows the [Arctic Versioning Specification][arcver] (ArcVer) which is a lightweight and fully compatible derivative of Semantic Versioning (SemVer). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for enhancements like new features and improvements, and major versions for any backwards incompatible changes. Deprecation warnings are introduced for breaking changes in a minor version so that users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance. Every significant change is documented in the changelog .

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us via email . Your reports will be taken seriously and not dismissed or argued with. What we believe in and how we act \u00b6 In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We welcome people regardless of these or other attributes. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement. We believe that a diverse community where people treat each other with respect is stronger, more vibrant and has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas. We aim for more diversity. We are kind, welcoming and courteous to everyone. We are respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments and their efforts. We are attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we are tactful and respectful when approaching differing views and experiences. We are aware that language shapes reality. Thus, we use inclusive, gender-neutral language in the documents we provide and when we talk to people.

Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of profanity offensive and off-putting. Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people\u2019s desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this Code of Conduct. Please avoid unstructured critique. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome. Publishing others\u2019 private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Responsibilities \u00b6 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Enforcement \u00b6 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project core team members or owner via email . The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project\u2019s leadership. Consequences for Violations \u00b6 If a participant engages in any behaviour violating this Code of Conduct, the core team members and project owner of this project may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project, exclusion from any interaction and loss of all rights in this project. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
