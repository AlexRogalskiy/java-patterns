# Troubleshooting

## _Filing Bugs & Troubleshooting_

These are required prerequisites before filing an issue on GitHub

### Step 1: Attempt To Upgrade fastpages

See the [Upgrading guide](https://github.com/AlexRogalsky/object-mappers-playground/blob/master/UPGRADE.md).

**In addition to upgrading**, if developing locally, refresh your Docker containers with the following
commands from the root of your repo:

`make remove` followed by `make build`

### Step 2: Search Relevant Places For Similar Issues

-   \[ ] Search issues on the [repository](https://github.com/AlexRogalsky/object-mappers-playground/) for a
    similar problems?
-   \[ ] Read the [README](https://github.com/AlexRogalsky/object-mappers-playground/blob/master/README.md)
    carefully

### Step 3: Observe Build Logs When Developing Locally

-   \[ ] Run the
    [fastpages blog server locally](https://github.com/AlexRogalskiy/object-mappers-playground/tree/411b3cc78f62a724d9d5eab4c09535e4ed36ceb3/docs/user-guide/DEVELOPMENT.md)
    -   Pay attention to the emitted logs when you save your notebooks or files. Often, you will see errors
        here that will give you important clues.
-   \[ ] When developing locally, you will notice that Jupyter notebooks are converted to corresponding
    Markdown files in the `_posts` folder. Take a look at the problematic blog posts and see if you can spot
    the offending HTML or Markdown in that code.
-   Use your browser's developer tools to see if there are any errors. Common errors are (1) not able to find
    images because they have not been saved into the right folder, (2) JavaScript or other errors.
-   If you receive a Jekyll build error or a Liquid error, search for this error on Stack Overflow to provide
    more insight on the problem.

### Step 4: See if there are errors in the build process of GitHub Actions.

-   \[ ] In your GitHub repository, you will have a tab called **Actions**. To find build errors, click on the
    `Event` dropdown list and select `push`. Browse through the logs to see if you can find an error. If you
    receive an error, read the error message and try to debug.

### Step 5: Once you have performed all the above steps, post your issue in the fastai forums or a GitHub Issue.

-   \[ ] If you cannot find a similar issue create a new thread instead of commenting on an unrelated one.
-   When reporting a bug, provide this information:
    1. Steps to reproduce the problem
    2. A link to the notebook or Markdown file where the error is occurring
    3. If the error is happening in GitHub Actions, a link to the specific error along with how you are able
       to reproduce this error. You must provide this **in addition to the link to the notebook or markdown
       file**.
    4. A screenshot / dump of relevant logs or error messages you are receiving from your local development
       environment. The local development server as indicated in the
       [development guide](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/_fastpages_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

**You must provide ALL of the above information**.

## _Frequent Errors_

1. Malformed front matter. Note that anything defined in front matter must be valid YAML. **Failure to provide
   valid YAML could result in your page not rendering** in your blog. For example, if you want a colon in your
   title you must escape it with double quotes like this:

    `- title: "Deep learning: A tutorial"`

    Or in a notebook

    `# "Deep learning: A tutorial"`

    See this [tutorial on YAML](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/) for
    more information.

    **Colons, tilde, asterisk and other characters may cause your front matter to break and for your posts to
    not render.** If you violate these conventions you often get an error that looks something like this:

    ```bash
     Error: YAML Exception reading ... (<unknown>): mapping values are not allowed
    ```

2. Can you customize the styling or theme? **A**: See
