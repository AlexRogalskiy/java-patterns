## Customer Data
All content and information that you submit through use of our Products and Services, or that we receive via integration with Third Party Services, that personally identifies you is referred to herein as “Customer Data”.

To create an account, integrate with Third Party Services, or receive information from us about future Products and Services, we may collect such Customer Data as your name and email address. In order to process billing, we may collect such Customer Data as your home or work address, telephone number, and/or credit card information.

However, this information is on an “opt-in” basis only and we will only collect such Customer Data if you specifically and expressly provide the information to us.

We may also automatically collect, receive and store certain information from you whenever you interact with our Products and Services. As is standard practice, Nullables.io may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from any devices you use to access our Products and services, including your IP address, cookie information, and data you requested.


## Cookies
We use Cookies to collect non-personal data and information. Cookies are small text files used to recognize repeat users, and are typically placed on your device by a web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie to you. The way Cookie function is by assigning a unique identifier to each device that has no meaning outside of the assigning web server.

You should be aware that should any of our third-party partners use Cookies, we cannot control their use of said Cookies (or the resulting information). You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline Cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline Cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our Products and Services that depend on Cookies.


## Third Party Analytics
We may use third party analytics providers and products to obtain, compile, and analyze Data for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how customers are using and interacting with our Products and Services.

These analytics providers may use a variety of technologies or tools to recognize your devices and/or to collect or compile this information. While we have no control over the technologies, tools, or practices of the third parties that provide analytics products and services to us, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that such third party analytics providers have adopted and maintain programs and procedures that are reasonably calculated for the protection of privacy and security similar to our own standards.

We will protect the privacy and security of your Data according to our Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored.


## Location Data
We may request permission via our App, to collect and use the Location from your device to provide contextual Data. (Example: you may want to see work-related tasks while at the office.) If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. Our Products and Services do not require your Location Data.


## We Do Not Collect Children’s Data
Our Products and Services are intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect any Customer Data from children. If a user identifies themselves as under 13 years of age, we will block such user from providing Customer Data and remove them from our systems.

If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us, you may opt-out at any time, or [notify us via email](mailto:unsubscribe@nullables.io). (Please include sufficient information for us to identify you, including your name, email address and any other specifics of your request.)
