name: Spell Check

# Comment management is handled through a secondary job, for details see:
# https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature%3A-Restricted-Permissions
#
# `jobs.comment-push` runs when a push is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   (in odd cases, it might actually run just to collapse a comment, but that's fairly rare)
#   it needs `contents: write` in order to add a comment.
#
# `jobs.comment-pr` runs when a pull_request is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   or collapse a comment (in the case where it had previously made a comment and now no longer needs to show a comment)
#   it needs `pull-requests: write` in order to manipulate those comments.
